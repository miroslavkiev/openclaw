## Incident: Workspace Synchronization Error
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Description**: During the initial attempt to push local workspace changes to the remote repository, an incorrect `git reset` command was used. This caused 171 essential files (including skills, scripts, and configurations) to be marked as deleted in the commit `bb63226`.
- **Resolution**:
    1. Identified the massive file deletion.
    2. Restored all missing files by checking them out from the last healthy state (`c06c8a6`).
    3. Verified the integrity of the `skills/`, `launchagents/`, and `scripts/` directories.
    4. Committed the restoration and synchronized the repository to the correct state.
- **Lesson Learned**: Always use `git merge` or `git pull --rebase` for initial synchronization instead of destructive resets, and verify file counts before committing large changes.
