- Heartbeat: checked pending-after-restart (auth still expired for google-gemini-cli work). Added proactive ideas (retry logic, health checks).

### Incident: Workspace Synchronization Error (resolved)
- Description: During an attempt to push local workspace changes, an incorrect `git reset` caused ~171 essential files (skills, scripts, configs) to be marked deleted (commit `bb63226`).
- Resolution:
  1. Identified the massive deletion.
  2. Restored missing files by checking out from the last healthy state (`c06c8a6`).
  3. Verified integrity of `skills/`, `launchagents/`, and `scripts/`.
  4. Committed the restoration and synced repo to the correct state.
- Lesson learned: Prefer `git merge`/`git pull --rebase` for sync, avoid destructive resets, and verify file counts before committing large changes.
