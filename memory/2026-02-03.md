- pending-after-restart.md: all items marked DONE; nothing outstanding.
- Proactive ideas updated: track WhatsApp flaps + heartbeat channel status diff logging.
- Fix: gmail-drafter false "LLM returned empty draft" due to clawdbot --json schema mismatch; updated parser to read res.result.payloads[0].text and tolerate non-JSON prelude; restarted com.mk.gmail-drafter.
- Added endpoint: POST /gmail-work/reprocess {messageId, force?} to requeue a message for drafting.
- Fix: reprocess endpoint now enriches headers via Gmail API when only messageId provided; reprocessed 19c2372a910c69aa and draft was created successfully.
- Fix: mass heuristic overcounted recipients because display names contain commas (e.g., "Surname, Name"); switched recipient counting to extract email addresses. Reclassified 19c23e69bfe2d84b (RE: HAFCaCP - SoW Draft - 2026-Q2) as personal and draft created.
