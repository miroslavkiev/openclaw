# 2026-02-01 — Daily Log (continued)

## 16:50 — Skill Installations
- Installed and configured `humanizer` (writing hygiene).
- Installed `youtube-watcher` (requires `yt-dlp`).
- Installed `clawdhub` (agent skill registry CLI).
- Installed `proactive-agent` (proactive behavior patterns & heartbeats).
- Installed `memory-setup` (standardized memory folder structure).

## Decisions
- Switched to standard memory structure: `memory/{logs,projects,groups,system}/`.
- Enabled proactive heartbeats in `HEARTBEAT.md`.
- Confirmed use of local `ha.py` for Home Assistant instead of ClawdHub alternative.
