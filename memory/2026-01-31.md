## Home Assistant integration
- Added a workspace skill `skills/homeassistant/` with a small Python helper (`ha.py`) to call HA REST endpoints.
- HA connectivity configured via OpenClaw config env injection (`skills.entries.homeassistant.env.HA_URL/HA_TOKEN`).
- Note: HA token was shared via chat; recommended to revoke and re-issue.

## Shopping list automation
- Canonical shopping list: `/Users/mk/clawd/shopping-list.md`.
- Requirement: every Saturday morning at 10:00 (Europe/Berlin), ensure items exist even if deleted during the week:
  - "червона риба солона"
  - "авокадо"
- Implemented via macOS LaunchAgent (launchd), not HA:
  - Script: `/Users/mk/clawd/scripts/shopping_list_weekly_staples.py`
  - LaunchAgent label: `ai.openclaw.shopping-list-weekly-staples`
  - Logs: `/tmp/openclaw-shopping-list-weekly-staples.out.log` + `.err.log`

## Backup/restore convention
- Store LaunchAgent plists in repo under `launchagents/`.
- Symlink into `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` and load with `launchctl`.
- Current LaunchAgents present:
  - `ai.openclaw.gateway.plist` (existing)
  - `ai.openclaw.shopping-list-weekly-staples.plist` (symlink to repo)
