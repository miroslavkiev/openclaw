- Investigated missing Gmail drafts: not empty input, but our parsing of `clawdbot agent --json` was too strict (only `payloads[0].text`).
- User requested: no fallback email body when LLM output is empty.
- Implemented:
  - Ensure every draft body includes `Kind regards,` before the appended HTML signature.
  - Skip creating drafts for Google Calendar notification emails (invites/updates/cancellations), via subject/snippet/from heuristics.
  - Fixed draft HTML rendering so bullet points become real HTML lists (not plain text).
  - Fixed signature spacing so there is exactly one line break after `Kind regards,`.
  - Fixed quoting so previous message content is included in Gmail-like quote block.
- Recovery script updated to:
  - Delete existing drafts for a thread before recreating.
  - Apply the same calendar-skip logic.
  - Add `Kind regards,` before signature.
- Recreated drafts for last 3 messages with new logic: 2 calendar notifications skipped, 1 non-calendar draft created.
