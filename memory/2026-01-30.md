- Myroslav requested visibility for Gmail auto-drafter: label threads after classification.
  - Labels: `personal` and `mass` (create on demand).
- Implemented labeling in `services/gmail-drafter/gmail-drafter.js` and documented in `memory/work-email-auto-drafter-rules.md` and `MEMORY.md`.
- Root cause when labels did not appear: LaunchAgents were not restarted after code changes. Fixed by restarting:
  - `com.mk.gmail-drafter`
  - `com.mk.gog.gmail-work-serve`
- Preference: whenever I create or modify services/automations/scripts (LaunchAgents, cron, etc.), I must update memory proactively without Myroslav prompting.
