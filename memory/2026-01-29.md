# 2026-01-29

- Fixed gmail-drafter automation reliability: `gog gmail watch serve` hook calls were timing out ("context canceled"). Updated `services/gmail-drafter/gmail-drafter.js` to ACK webhook immediately and process draft creation asynchronously in background queue.
- Gmail-drafter behavior reminders:
  - Reply-to-all (preserve CC)
  - Use To recipients from inbound email
  - Greeting: pass display name to LLM and ask it to extract first name
